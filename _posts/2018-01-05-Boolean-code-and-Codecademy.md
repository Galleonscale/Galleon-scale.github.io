    <td>I managed to get through 3 sections between my first lesson and the second lesson,I got onto boolean code,boolean code was more difficult as it didn't make sense to me at first,but as I progressed through the section and started reading the box that contained instructions,I found it easier to understand and much easier to get through the exercise,I learnt by a method of logical,lateral thinking and trial and error .
Logically and laterally thinking really helped as it made me think inside and outside of the box,this helped me advance more quickly but more methodically ,as it helped to understand how the code worked as understanding how the code worked was essential to working out how to do and actually do the exercise.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by trying to help the person sitting next to me,and being distracted by other things,trying to help the person sitting next to me ,helped me understand the code better,but paused or stopped me from working entirely ,me being distracted also hindered my learning progress as it stopped me from working as I was distracted one way or the other,I also limited my learning by not focusing on the work ,this stopped or slowed me down dramatically as it hindered progress or stopped it entirely.
Habits such as distracting myself and not focusing on the work,I should focus on these as it will help me improve overall efficiency and helping me to understand the code better</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the factors of not focusing and distractions,as it will help me next lesson ,if I change the factor of not focusing,I will be able to work more effectively and work more efficiently ,if I also change the factors of distractions,I can work quicker,more methodically and most importantly think logically and laterally,by changing these two aspects ,I can work much more efficiently and methodically ,whilst understanding how code itself works.
I will improve my learning by changing aspects of learning listed up above I could  think more logically and laterally,whilst working more methodically but more efficiently ,this will eventually help me make more progress overall.</td>
