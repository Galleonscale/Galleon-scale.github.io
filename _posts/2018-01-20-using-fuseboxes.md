  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned through a good level of communication with my partner , following the instructions but tweaking them if we got the code wrong.
A strategy that was effective was working efficiently with my partner whilst following the instructions,this proved a effective combo as we worked quite well and efficiently to successfully complete two of the instructions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the fact that we didn't communicate as much as we could have,the first time we tried to save something on our USB sticks we found that we couldnâ€™t safe it on the the other one, this was because we had both of them plugged in at the same time ,as it only registered one of the USB sticks.
The habits I need to work on are the ones which limited my learning,such as not communicating with my partner and not trusting my partner .</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will communicate more with my partner whilst trusting him more next time , I also could have listened to him more.
I will improve my learning by making sure that we can successfully save and import stuff from our USB sticks, I also need to set up our fuse box quicker so we can get started earlier and work more efficiently.</td>
