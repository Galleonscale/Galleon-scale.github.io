  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by communicating with my partner and trusting him as this was more efficient than flitting back and forth between the instructions,another good tactic was tweaking the code so we could iron out the bugs,this helped us learn and understand the code.
Communicating with my partner was a very effective strategy as we can now write code more efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rushing ahead limited my learning as we were more prone to make mistakes ,so we had to tweak them repeatedly as we made many mistakes, this stopped us moving on earlier,another thing that limited my learning was the problem we had saving our codes,in the first lesson with fuze boxes we managed to save our work, but in the next we were unable to save until we worked it out.
Rushing is a habit I should work on as I would be less prone to making mistakes,and wouldn't need to spend more time tweaking the bugs in the code</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will need to work more efficiently ,but more carefully so I or my partner donâ€™t make mistakes that often, I should also make my voice clearer so my partner can hear me properly and not make mistakes.
I will improve my learning by working fast but not fast enough to make mistakes this will help me move on in the lesson so I learn more as a result.</td>
