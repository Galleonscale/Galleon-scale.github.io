  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions and not rushing through the instructions as my partner sometimes asked me to repeat and this hindered progression onto other instructions.
Strategies that were effective were ones were we coordinated so we could work more efficiently and more cooperatively as when we didn't we found that we made many many mistakes and we had to spend more time fixing our mistakes than moving on.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not cooperating with my partner and making many mistakes with the code and rushing through the instructions ,many times I found that me or my partner had made mistakes and we had to correct them.
Overall I think that I made many mistakes as I had a bad habit e.g. not cooperating with partner and rushing through instructions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I change the fact that me and my partner didn’t cooperate as we were distracted and not rush through the instructions,I will cooperate with my partner whilst reading the instructions more carefully.
I will improve my learning by cooperating with  my partner and reading the instructions/relaying them to my partner a little slower as this will greatly decrease the chance for mistakes and the time as we wouldn’t have to tweak to code to make sure it was right</td>
