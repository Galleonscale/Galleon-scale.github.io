    <td>the instructions were starting to get longer and longer,this helped us learn as we repeatedly had to edit the code so ,when we ran it the code wouldn't have failed ,we wouldn't have to rewrite or the bits of code that were wrong.
Strategies that were effective were strategies that helped me and my partner cooperate and work more efficiently,they were repeatedly long instructions helped us understand each other's habits,this made it easier as the instructions got longer and longer ,another strategy that was quite effective was trial and error as this helped us understand the code.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>we limited by learning by distracting each other by accident on many occasions ,bugs in the code was one of the main limiters as we we couldn't move onto the next set of instructions ,it limited my learning by preventing me and my partner from moving on and learning new commands and bits of code, another major limiter was trying to work as fast as possible so we could get onto the next set of instructions,but it didn’t work as we were more prone to make mistakes,this hindered progress and we couldn’t move further quicker
A few habits I needed to work on were quite varied ,but they were many, such as being distracted and the need to rush ,these habits proved ineffective as they slowed us down,I should work on them by trying not to get distracted and instead of rushing working slower and more methodically,hopefully this will work so we can move onto other instructions quicker without fail.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact that me and my partner were getting distracted and the fact that we were trying to rush ahead with our code,this didn’t work as me and my partner were more prone to make mistakes as we didn’t check the words and sometimes mistyped the words.
I will improve my learning by not being distracted and not rushing ahead,I will be able to work more efficiently and be able to not be more prone to mistakes,this will help me as I will be able to work more efficiently and be less prone to making mistakes though this will be more methodical and slow ,overall this will save me and my partner lots of time.</td>
