    <td>during writing the code for opinions.fuze we made and corrected many mistakes,some of the mistakes we made we didn't realise we made or forgot to correct them ,this helped us understand the code better and helped us avoid similar mistakes next time ,I also learnt through trial and error as it helped me and my partner learn how to correct the code.
We used many strategies such as trial and error and cooperation,these were the most effective as they helped by making us work more together and helped both of us learn from our mistakes,this proved effective as if we encountered similar pieces of code and made mistakes we could easily correct them ,the same is for the latter as cooperation made it easier for one of us to notice the mistakes before we ran the code</td>

  <tr>
    <td>factors such as making mistakes and not working efficiently limited my learning by n to letting me and my partner continue,thus hindering progress, these factors limited my learning by stopping me and my partner from learning brand new or different ways to piece together code,not working efficiently as me and my partner as we could have it limited me and my partnerâ€™s learning as we weren't working efficiently to get back the time we lost when making mistakes.
Me and my partner had many habits we needed to work on such as not working efficiently and making many mistakes,this could have all been avoided by checking the code we just wrote we could have avoided not working efficiently as we could have easily worked much quicker and efficiently.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Me and my partner will change the factors of working efficiently  and making many mistakes I will change this by trying to not make mistakes,by working more methodically and more slowly so me and my partner could see the mistakes we made and could correct them,I will work more efficiently as this affects how much you could progress in class,thus hindering or speeding up progress ,I will use both of these methods to change for the next IT lesson.
I will improve me and my partners learning by using the methods above,this will improve my learning by helping me advance onwards to new and more advanced instructions,by helping me learn new bits of code and new ways to piece that code together,this will improve my learning dramatically as it will give me ,essentially more pieces of code and more ways to put the m together,helping me learn through trial and error /rely on previous knowledge to help me get past future problems me and my partner may encounter as we move on to more advanced instructions, for example fuze box instructions using electronics .</td>
