    <td>as In the next set of instructions,the instructions were getting consecutively longer and more difficult,as in the previous set of instructions me and my partner used previous bits of code we had already learnt,but now we learnt newer pieces of code which worked in different ways we didn't understand,we eventually learnt how do use them and also how they worked,another method was quite effective was talking and cooperating with my partner ,we both learnt as we shared knowledge,this helped both of us to work more efficiently as well as giving us more knowledge to work with.
Strategies such as cooperation and learning new bits of code were very effective as they boosted our learning dramatically and also helped me and my partner learn new pieces of code and how to use them.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>me and my partner limited each otherâ€™s learning by not cooperating,sometimes the navigator would be distracted and sometimes it would be the other way around ,other things that limited our learning was the abundance of mistakes and mishaps ,this greatly reduced the speed which me and my partner could move on with the work,a we had to repeatedly check and fix our mistakes.
Habits such as being distracted by minor abnormalities and abundance of mistakes to fix,I need to make less mistakes whilst not being distracted by the class or other abnormalities.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the factors of distraction and cooperation next time round,specifically I will not let myself be distracted as easily as before,and me and my partner will cooperate better,this will improve efficiency whilst also letting us share more knowledge previously learnt ,thus improving the work speed and the time it takes to fix mistakes.
I will improve my learning by working more quickly but more methodically so I will be able to make less mistakes,when telling my partner what to do ,I will speak slower and explain more to my partner so we will move quicker overall through the instructions,thus improving our overall efficiency whilst helping me and my partner learn new bits of code quicker but understanding the code better</td>
