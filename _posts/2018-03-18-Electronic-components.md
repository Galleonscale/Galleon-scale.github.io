    <td>last lesson things were a bit different as now we ,as we used the electronics component kit ,this made it more  difficult as we now had to deal with the wires and light bulbs as well as typing code,this made for a new experience and I learnt more as a consequence,another way I learnt was by fixing my mistakes,when fixing mistakes I learnt and understood the code better.
I found strategies such as cooperation and fixing mistakes effective as I learnt more whilst also understanding how the code works.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>factors such as distractions and laziness limited my learning as it stopped me from cooperating and moving forward with the instructions, more importantly when fiddling with the electronic components,distractions limited me and my partners learning as it stopped us working or slowed us down ,laziness limited me and my partners learning ,as if either me or my partner was lazy ,this hindered a lot of progress as laziness stopped me and my partner from working .
I need to work on habits such as laziness and uncooperation ,as laziness stopped me and partner from working as efficiently as possible,uncooperation hindered progress whilst limiting me and my partners learning.</td>

    <td>I will change the factor of laziness ,uncooperation and distractions are all factors I should change for next time ,as all of them limited my learning ,uncooperation hindered me and my partners progress whilst limiting my learning because it stopped me and my partner from sharing knowledge,thus hindering me and my partners learning ,laziness stopped learning as it stopped either me and my partner from learning and distractions were a big factor I needed to change as it stopped a lot of learning and progress.
I will improve my learning by cooperating with me and my partner ,this will improve me and my partners learning as it will help us to work more efficiently whilst also helping me and my partner share our knowledge easier</td>
