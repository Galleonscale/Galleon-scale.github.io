    <td>As me and my partner moved steadily along with our coding ,as we also had to wire the lightbulbs to the breadboard of the fuzebox,this time instead of using one light bulb,we used many light bulbs,each flashing by one by one,once we had recorded and moved onto the the next set of instructions ,we found that 2 of the lightbulbs didn't light up ,so me and my partner rewired and changed the lightbulbs,then we moved on to the photo sensor ,this was much easier than the previous set of instructions,I learnt from this experience from trial and error and cooperation.
Strategies such as cooperation and trial and error were effective as from cooperation we could advance more quickly with the instructions ,helping me and my partner learn more as a consequence ,trial and error was equally effective as it helped both of us to understand the code ,both of these strategies increase productivity and efficiency overall</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>me and my partner limited our learning by arguing over minor objections and general inefficiency  ,these things limited me and my partners learning as it stopped and slowed us down ,arguing was a major stopper as it stopped cooperation whilst either stopping or slowing down progress.
Habits such as uncooperation and arguments ,were the ones I needed to work on as  they halted progress dramatically , by working on cooperation me and my partner could share more knowledge whilst working more efficiently,I should also work on general efficiency as this will help me and my partner to work quicker and more efficiently .</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the factor of uncooperation and arguing over minor objections next time ,changing the factor of uncooperation will help me and my partner to share more knowledge and help me and partner  to work more efficiently ,I should also stop arguing with my partner as often as this will decrease general effect whilst also stopping or halting progress.
I will improve my learning by changing the factors ,e.g uncooperation and arguing,this will improve learning by improving efficiency and stockpiling our overall knowledge,I should also use strategies that were effective to improve my learning,as that had already proved themselves to be effective,using them again will help me and my partner to advance furthermore and learn better.</td>
