    <td>this lesson was different , as we were simply improving on the code we had written last, this was the Photon sensor.fuze ,we simply added code to the original code ,this new code made a circle grow or decrease depending on the light the photon sensor was ,after that we moved on steadily until we reached the robot arm ,we didn't reach much with it as we only progressed onto the robot arm at the end of the lesson ,so we didn‘t have a video to show ,During this period me and my partner learnt by a mix of trial and error and cooperation .
Strategies such as cooperation and trial and error ,cooperation was effective as it helped me and my partner learn quicker and gave us a wider range of knowledge,trial and error was effective was it helped us understand how the code worked and how to fix the code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>me and my partner limited our learning by the method of uncooperation and distraction ,uncooperation limited me and my partner‘s learning by stopping us from sharing knowledge and slowing down me and me partners general efficiency ,distractions limited me and my partners overall learning.
Habits such as distractions and general inefficiency are some of the habits me and my partner needed to work on ,general inefficiency were habits me and my partner needed to work on as it hindered progress by a great amount ,distractions were also a major factor as it stopped us from working and lowered general efficiency overall.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the factors of uncooperation and being distracted for the next lesson,as these will help me improve my learning ,I will change uncooperation and cooperate more with my partner ,this will help with overall efficiency and help us share knowledge ,I will also try to be less distracted ,this will help me to become less distracted whilst improving efficiency as a whole.
I will improve my learning by using strategies that were already effective,such as cooperation and trial and error, habits such as uncooperation and distractions I should change ,this should help improve efficiency whilst also helping us work together better and more productively,
I should also be more productive and efficient,as this will help with the productivity and efficiency as a whole.</td>
