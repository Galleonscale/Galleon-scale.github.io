    <td>this lesson was largely different as before we had worked on BASIC code in the fuzeboxes , but now we were using codecademy to learn how to use javascript,firstly we made a codecademy account so we could use the java course ,at first the Java course started out pretty simple asking you to print some words in the JavaScript gradually it got harder, so it took more time to figure how to do each and every exercise , I got onto part 13  of a 14 part section 1,I learnt mostly by applying logic and through trial and error .
Strategies such as trial expand error and applying logic to the parts helped improve efficiency ,these were effective as it gradually helped me to understand how the code worked and helped me avoid the mistakes next time around.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not focusing on the work and getting stuck on several parts of the first section as each of the parts got consecutively harder so it took longer and longer for me to advance to the next part,this limited my learning as it stopped me from learning newer and more advanced pieces of JavaScript coding ,not focusing limited my learning as it slowed progress whilst also sometimes stopping me from working entirely which stopped learning altogether.
Habits such as inefficiency and not focusing. Are the habits I need to work on as each of these habits cost a lot of learning time whilst hindering progress and learning,I need to specifically work on not focusing as it  directly affects inefficiency.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work faster and more logically whilst reading the instructions and demonstrations so I can understand how the code works and how to do the part I am currently on much easier and quicker ,so I can make much more progress with the section ,I will also work more logically as if I am unsure I can read the instructions step by step and hopefully figure out how to debug or complete the code ,this will help me understand and work more efficiently .
I will improve my learning by learning to work more efficiently and more effectively as this will help me be more proactive and help me make more progress whilst also helping to work more methodically and quickly,I will also learn to think laterally and logically as this will help me get past the parts more effectively </td>
