    <td>I am learning more things every IT lesson ,as I advance through the exercises I learn more and more ,this lesson introduced many more pieces of JavaScript that made different and new things happen ,for example the import piece of code,which let me import a maths block ,which let the code perform maths.
Strategies such as trial and error ,cooperation and just thinking about the problem altogether , trial and error helped me to understand the code whilst also helping me understand how to fix it if I encountered it next time ,cooperation helped me understand previous or further pieces of code ,and just thinking about it was hugely effective.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning ,by getting distracted and not reading the instructions this really inhibited my learning as it stopped me from absorbing more knowledge whilst simultaneously stopping me from advancing through codecademy, getting distracted really inhibited progress as it stopped me actually typing the code and stopping me from working altogether , not reading the instructions me stopped from actually understanding how to write the code and how the code works.
Habits such as not paying attention,getting distracted are some of the many habits that I need to work on,as if I work on them it will greatly increase productivity and general efficiency.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change the factors of getting distracted and not reading instructions ,whilst keeping the factors of trial and error and cooperation,I will change the factors of getting distracted and bit reading the instructions ,as it will help me to improve how I learn and my general efficiency with codecademy.
I will improve my learning by making myself change the factors above ,for example if I actually read the instructions I will be able to help myself to learn how to do the code whilst also letting myself understand the code improving how I learn,if I stop getting distracted I can work much more quickly and more efficiently making better use of my time so I can learn more.</td>
