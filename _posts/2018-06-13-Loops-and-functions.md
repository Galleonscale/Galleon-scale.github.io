    <td>in this lesson I couldn't ask for help as he needed to move to another computer as his was broken.
The best tactics I used to learn was trial and error and using previous knowledge to help me work out the exercise this worked really well as ,using trial and error helped me understand how the code worked,using previous knowledge helped me to work on previous tasks at the  same time as this one.
Strategies such as trial and error helped me to understand how the code worked, this made them really effective.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Limiters such as distractions and me not focusing really limited my learning ,as distractions slowed down or stopped me from working altogether ,and me not focusing didn’t help as well ,sometimes me not focusing really affected my learning stopping me from working or slowing progress.
Habits such as getting distracted and making many mistakes really affected progress as it stopped me from working and sometimes slowed me down from making anymore progress in that particular section.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time I will work harder,faster and more efficiently whilst thinking about the problem laterally and logically as ,working harder,faster and more efficiently will help me understand the code better ,and help me work and make progress more quickly ,thinking logically and laterally will help me bypass and learn how to defeat the problem differently each time ,helping me to understand in what ways the code works.
I will improve my learning by changing the factors listed above ,as it will help me understand the problem itself ,helping me understand how the code works ,and thus improving and accelerating my learning ,by doing this I can also improve my learning by simply focusing and stopping myself from getting distracted as this will improve my learning even more .</td>
