Strategies such as thinking logically and laterally helped me to advance quickly and effectively ,these strategies were effective as it helped me to advance and to look at the problem in different ways.</td>

Habits such as getting distracted and not focusing are some of the many habits I need to work on ,if I work on those habits ,I will help my self to have a better more efficient learning and working on those habits will help me to tackle more troublesome habits.</td>
