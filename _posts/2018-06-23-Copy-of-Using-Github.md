    <td>this lesson my aim was to finish battleships , the aim of the battleships sections was to build a battleship game in ,problems happened ,sometimes the "run" button wouldn't work ,so an effective learning strategy was to do trial and error as it helped me to identify errors and mistakes so I could avoid them next time , I also learnt by thinking about the problems from various angles , this helped me to learn as I could understand in what ways the problem would work ,and this would help me learn more.
Strategies such as thinking laterally and logically were really effective as they helped me view each section and problem differently which helped me to find more different solutions ,which boosted my learning.</td>

    <td>factors such as distractions and not being focused limited my learning as each of them hindered my learning in their specific ways ,distractions ,sometimes slowed me or stopped me from completely working at all me not focusing ,was a completely different matter ,it stopped me from focusing which slowed down efficiency and sometimes stopped me from working altogether.
Habits such as getting distracted and not focusing are some of the habits I need to work on as working on those habits will help me to work without pausing or slowing down now and then .</td>
