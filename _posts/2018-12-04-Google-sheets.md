    <td>In our first lesson in computer science, we were learning about google sheets, we were shown the Caesar cypher, or more, i.e a is z and b is a, etc then we were a shown how to convert words (each letter in a single cell) into the code, then we were told to turn, and figure out, how to make the encoded message back into what the message was meant to say in the first place, not a bunch of gibberish, though unlike other people I recopied the alphabet into a different part ,and for decoding simply used that set instead.
Difficulties such as simply not understanding what to do and doing it to fast tended to cause mistakes.</td>

    <td>To conclude I think that this lesson was generally a good lesson , I worked through the lesson efficiently but quickly ,which tended to cause mistakes,I simply  could have avoided this by working more slowly ,a mistake I made was. forgetting to put O in my alphabet this caused my decoder to malfunction as it had no O I could have avoided this by typing the alphabet more slowly ,another way to avoid mistakes is to work efficiently using the time I have for focusing on the work.</td>
